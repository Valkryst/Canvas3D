# 3D Canvas

The Canvas3D Java class is a simple 3D graphics application that allows users to interact with and manipulate 3D geometric shapes (pyramid and octahedron) using keyboard and mouse input. The application provides a 3D view of the scene, supports different transformations (translation, rotation, and scaling), and allows users to switch between orthographic and perspective projections.

## Features

- **Keyboard Controls:**
  - W, A, S, D, Q, E keys to move the camera forward, backward, left, right, up, and down, respectively.

- **Toggle Active Figure:**
  - P key to toggle between the active geometric figures (pyramid and octahedron).

- **Reset Figure Position:**
  - C key to return the selected figure to its original position.

- **Transformations:**
  - **Rotation:** R key in combination with mouse drag to rotate the selected figure.
  - **Scaling:** T key in combination with mouse drag to scale the selected figure.
  - **Translation:** SHIFT key in combination with mouse drag to translate the selected figure.

- **Controls:**
  - Show/Hide Axes: M key to toggle the visibility of coordinate axes.
  - Show/Hide Cubic Lines: N key to toggle the visibility of cubic lines.
  - Toggle Octahedron: 1 key to show/hide the octahedron.
  - Toggle Pyramid: 2 key to show/hide the pyramid.
  - SPACE key to toggle between orthographic and perspective projections.
